# Hey there, Im Rayan ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic student majoring in computer science, currently in my second year at Ontario Tech University. I have an established track record in user-interface designing and front-end development of mobile applications, namely the Android version of a mobile app for the MY Voice Canada organization, which was created using platforms such as Figma, Miro, and Flutter SDK in Dart. Throughout my academic career, I have obtained skills in a variety of additional programming languages, such as C++, Python, x86-64 Assembly, and Java. At the moment, I work throughout the week as a car washer for Avis Budget Group while concurrently studying at Ontario Tech. More personally, I like to push myself beyond my comfort zone, which is why I volunteered to become a summer camp counsellor at a local church and actively participated in school activities and clubs. This has dramatically improved my interpersonal abilities and made me a more effective team member, with an emphasis on helping others. I am ready to contribute groundbreaking discoveries to any task at hand and use my professional expertise to drive technical progress.
